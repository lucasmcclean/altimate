# Altimate

Web accessibility, despite becoming more broadly addressed, is still a widely
misunderstood and underrecognized challenge. Many websites fail to address common
web accessibility concerns, and many more fail to address lesser-known issues
that, regardless, have a large impact on people's lives.

## Making Accessibility Available to Devs and Users Alike

Many applications, linters, and practices guide devs to design more accessible
sites. **Altimate** (/ˈʌl.tɪ.mɪt/) takes a different approach by meeting developers
where they are with already published sites and granting users the power to bring
accessibility to any site they visit.

## Reaching Beyond Basic Accessibility

Tools that can statically analyze and programmatically address accessibility issues
serve a foundational role on the web. But there is a strong lack of 'semantic'
accessibility tools that can take their role one step further by making context-aware
decisions and taking unique approaches to ensuring an accessible web. **Altimate**
does just that.
